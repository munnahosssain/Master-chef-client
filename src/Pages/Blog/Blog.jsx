            form validation to your forms. It doesn't matter what changes the
            form elements. Their values are safe in our local states, so that's

            refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React
            state.

          How to validate React props using PropTypes
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            We can use PropTypes to validate the types of props that a component
            receives. PropTypes is a built-in feature in React that allows you
            to specify the expected types of each prop in the component's
            propTypes object. If a prop is of an incorrect type, React will
            generate a warning.

          Difference between nodejs and express js.

          <p>
            Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
            outside of a web browser. Express.js is a web framework built on top
            of Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications
            by providing a set of features and utilities, such as routing,
            middleware, and tempesting.

          What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>
            A custom hook is a reusable function that allows you to share
            stateful logic between components. Custom hooks are created by
            extracting common logic from components into a separate function
            that can be called from any component. This improves code
            maintainability and scalability, and reduces code duplication.
