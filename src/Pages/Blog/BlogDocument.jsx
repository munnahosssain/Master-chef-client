          Differences between uncontrolled and controlled components.

          Controlled components: are predictable because the state of the form
          elements is handled by the component.Controlled components enable you
          to effectively employ form validation to your forms. It doesn't matter
          what changes the form elements. Their values are safe in our local
          states, so that's where we perform our validation. Uncontrolled
          components: are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM
          itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact that these components are
          not controlled by React state.

          How to validate React props using PropTypes
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ padding: "10px 20px" }}>
          We can use PropTypes to validate the types of props that a component
          receives. PropTypes is a built-in feature in React that allows you to
          specify the expected types of each prop in the component's propTypes
          object. If a prop is of an incorrect type, React will generate a
          warning.

          Difference between nodejs and express js.

        <Text style={{ padding: "10px 20px" }}>
          Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside
          of a web browser. Express.js is a web framework built on top of
          Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications by
          providing a set of features and utilities, such as routing,
          middleware, and tempesting.

          What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
        </Text>
        <Text style={{ padding: "10px 20px" }}>
          A custom hook is a reusable function that allows you to share stateful
          logic between components. Custom hooks are created by extracting
          common logic from components into a separate function that can be
          called from any component. This improves code maintainability and
          scalability, and reduces code duplication.
