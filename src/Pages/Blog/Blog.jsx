                Controlled components are predictable because the state of the
                form elements is handled by the component.Controlled components
                enable you to effectively employ form validation to your forms.
                It doesn't matter what changes the form elements. Their values
                are safe in our local states, so that's where we perform our
                validation
                <br />
                Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is
                handled by the DOM itself. “Uncontrolled” refers to the fact
                that these components are not controlled by React state.

                How to validate React props using PropTypes
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                We can use PropTypes to validate the types of props that a
                component receives. PropTypes is a built-in feature in React
                that allows you to specify the expected types of each prop in
                the component's propTypes object. If a prop is of an incorrect
                type, React will generate a warning.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
                outside of a web browser. Express.js is a web framework built on
                top of Node.js that simplifies the process of building web
                applications by providing a set of features and utilities, such
                as routing, middleware, and tempesting.

                What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                A custom hook is a reusable function that allows you to share
                stateful logic between components. Custom hooks are created by
                extracting common logic from components into a separate function
                that can be called from any component. This improves code
                maintainability and scalability, and reduces code duplication.
