## Project Purpose

This project was made to test my knowledge on the basic structure of a website in html and css. It serves as my another full length project started. Since this project was a test of my knowledge, i used as little help resources.

This allowed me to see where my strengths where and which sections i needed to work on.

## Final thoughts

This project was not easy at all and the longer i worked on it, the more it took out of me. I started strong and i burnt out 80% through. With that being said, it has also been my favorite project so far because i did not rely fully on tutorials to complete it. I only used tutorials to understand smaller concepts and not full sections.
